# ELC ShowStore Controller

The ELC Show Store Controller is a JavaScript application that provides a user-friendly interface for managing and controlling multiple light shows on your ELC ShowStore within a web-based environment.  It enables users to select different player modes (single-player, multi-player, or recording), load and play shows, and control playback using various buttons (play, stop, loop, hold, continue, restart).
